We have code coverage tools like jacoco and analysis tools like Sonar Lint

case-1) in this case, suppose it is maven project so we have to run the goals of a plugin
        if you run jacoco plugin goal(report) will be genrated and placed in the target directory folder
        this is for code coverage but incase of analysis i.e sonar tool this toll also will have some plugin 
        and goals. if you run those it will analysis the code and placed inside the SonarQube server. 
        bydefault it will place bcz it is running under default port i.e 9000 if it is not running under 
        this port we need to configuration in the remote location server it will displays the code coverage 
        report and code smells and bugs also when ever you run jacoco plugin it will genrate one jacoco.ece f
        ile it is in binary format.this file will be place inside of the server and it will displays it
      
case-2) In this case if your project is Normal Project you can use the benfits from Eclipse bcz Eclipse is 
        comming up set of plugins like sonarLint for analysing and jacoco for code coverage. you can apply 
        this plugins to normal as well as Maven Projects also. it will dispalys the results there itself.
        but it is for local machine. and more over these are not accurate when compared with SonarQube Server
        bcz Eclipse provided plugin rules for analysing may be different when compared with SonarQube Server
        
case-3)  In this case you can bind your projects to SonarQube projects. for this You have to download 
         sonar Qube Server as well as Sonar-Scanner and we have to provide some set of properties in 
         sonar-scanner.properties file means we have to specify the name of the project and version and 
         key and source location also. this project will have set of rules so the same rules will applicable
         to our eclipse project even though you are using sonar lint. so you can have same results 
         in local and SonarQube Server as well
